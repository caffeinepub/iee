# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add worker verification badges, employer favorites, job templates, availability calendar, and job reminders to enhance platform functionality.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement three-tier worker verification badge system (Bronze/Silver/Gold) based on completed job count
- Add employer favorites list to save and manage preferred workers
- Create job templates system for reusable job posting configurations
- Build worker availability calendar with day/week/month views
- Implement in-app notification center with job reminders and alerts

**User-visible outcome:** Workers earn verification badges as they complete jobs, can manage their availability calendar, and receive in-app notifications for upcoming shifts. Employers can save favorite workers, create reusable job templates, and view worker availability when reviewing candidates.
