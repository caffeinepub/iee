# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build the core foundation for WorkConnect, an employment marketplace connecting workers with employers through secure authentication, profile registration, job posting, and job browsing capabilities.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement Internet Identity authentication for secure login
- Create role selection flow (Worker or Employer) for new users
- Build worker registration with essential fields (name, mobile, location, skills, experience, wage range)
- Build employer job posting functionality (title, description, skills, wage, location, dates, positions)
- Implement job browsing interface with application functionality for workers
- Create separate dashboards for workers (view jobs, track applications) and employers (view posted jobs, see applications)
- Design landing page with clear call-to-action for registration and login
- Apply professional, cohesive visual design theme suitable for employment marketplace

**User-visible outcome:** Users can authenticate with Internet Identity, register as either a worker or employer, post or browse jobs, and manage their profiles and applications through role-specific dashboards with a professional, trustworthy interface.
