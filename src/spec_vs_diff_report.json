  "summary": "The implementation covers the majority of the BuildRequest requirements including worker and employer authentication, profile management, job posting, QR code generation, job matching algorithm, job discovery interface, attendance tracking, rating system, payment tracking, and dashboards. However, several specific features and acceptance criteria are missing, particularly around admin dashboard metrics, job candidate review interface, worker replacement requests, and specific UI design constraints.",

      "id": "REQ-11",
      "requirement": "Create admin dashboard with system-wide metrics including total workers registered, active employers count, total jobs posted, job fill rate percentage, average time to fill jobs, worker retention rate, and employer retention rate",
      "reason": "No admin dashboard page or component exists in the frontend. The backend contains SystemMetrics type and getSystemMetrics function, but there is no admin-specific UI implementation to display these metrics. No route for admin dashboard exists in App.tsx.",

      "requirement": "Implement employer job candidate review interface showing matched workers for each job posting with their reliability scores, skills, and distance, with ability to confirm worker slots and view auto-fill suggestions for bulk hiring",
      "reason": "No dedicated candidate review interface exists. EmployerJobList.tsx shows job listings but does not display matched candidates, their reliability scores, skills, distance, or provide confirm/auto-fill functionality for worker selection.",

      "requirement": "Design modern, professional, and minimal user interface using a clean color scheme that avoids blue and purple",
      "reason": "The CSS color scheme in index.css extensively uses blue and purple hues. Primary colors include chart-1 with blue value 145 and chart-4 with purple value 195. ExperienceLevelBadge.tsx explicitly uses bg-blue-100 and bg-purple-100 classes, directly violating the constraint to avoid these colors.",
